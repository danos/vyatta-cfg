This package has the Vyatta configuration system, including the configuration
back-end, the base configuration templates, and the config-mode CLI completion
mechanism.

The following is a write-up of notes from a TOI from James Davidson in June 2017, and attempts to give an overview of the content of this repo:

etc/
  bash_completion.d/
    vyatta-cfg - adds top-level command completion to bash
  default/
    vyatta-cfg - sets up HISTIGNORE to hide passwords etc
  logrotate.d/
    vyatta-config-logs - sets up logrotate settings

functions/
  interpreter/
    vyatta-cfg-run - run when you type 'set', calls cfgcli if in vbash
  script-wrapper - handles top level commands, calling cli-shell-api etc

perl_dmod/
  Cstore/
    - This is the perl API documented in the perl API doc.  This is a
	  perl extension (cstore.xs) and maps to our config API via Perl.
	  This was previously a Perl wrapper onto C++ Cstore before it was
	  rewritten in go.
      Lots of scripts use this so have to maintain it.

scripts/  (Way too many small bits and pieces!_
  vyatta-load-config.pl
  vyatta-save-config.pl
    - used by configd for load / save of config
  vcli - scripting interface on top of CLI

src/
  cli-shell-api.cpp - application which takes calls from the various scripts
    in 'scripts' and maps them onto calls into configd via the client /
	dispatcher socket interface
  client/
    - front end for calls into configd dispatcher via the configd socket,
	  implements config commands.
  cliexec/
    - bits of cstore we need to keep eg varrefs.  Bit like a bash wrapper,
	  sometimes spawned by configd to perform certain actions.
